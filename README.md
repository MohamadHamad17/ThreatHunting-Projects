This repository showcases a collection of **threat hunting investigations** that I have conducted and documented. Each project walks through the **full lifecycle of a hunt** â€” from preparation and data collection to analysis, investigation, response, and improvement.  

The hunts are based on **real-world scenarios** (e.g., devices accidentally exposed to the internet, brute force attempts, suspicious logons) and are mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** where applicable.

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside  

- **Step-by-step documentation** of each hunt  
- **KQL queries** used for log analysis in Microsoft Defender/Sentinel  
- **Mapped TTPs** aligned with MITRE ATT&CK  
- **Response actions** and remediation steps taken  
- **Lessons learned & improvements** for future hunts  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  

This repo serves both as a **personal knowledge base** and as a way to demonstrate:  
- Practical experience with **threat hunting methodology**  
- Ability to analyze logs, detect suspicious activity, and validate hypotheses  
- Familiarity with **enterprise security tools** and frameworks  
- A structured approach to documenting security investigations  

---

## ðŸš€ Why It Matters  

Threat hunting is about being **proactive** â€” not just waiting for alerts but actively searching for signs of compromise. These projects highlight my ability to:  

- Work with raw telemetry (log data, events, network signals)  
- Identify and confirm potential threats  
- Apply **defensive security best practices**  
- Strengthen an organizationâ€™s security posture through continuous improvement  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Frameworks  

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**  
- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**  
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

## ðŸ“Œ Note  

This repository is for **educational and professional demonstration purposes only**. All scenarios are documented responsibly with the goal of showcasing security knowledge and hands-on threat hunting skills.
